# Football Analysis

Developed a Football Analysis system leveraging YOLO and OpenCV. YOLO is utilized for real-time object detection, identifying players, referees, and the ball within video footage. We enhance player identification by employing Kmeans for pixel segmentation and clustering, enabling team assignment based on jersey colors. This facilitates the calculation of a team's ball possession percentage during a match. Optical flow analysis tracks camera movement across frames, facilitating precise player movement measurement. Perspective transformation is applied to convey scene depth and perspective, enabling movement measurement in meters rather than pixels. Finally, player speed and distance covered are computed to provide comprehensive analysis.
